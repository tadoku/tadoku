# Styleguide

This is the styleguide of the Tadoku website. It's an example of how to use the `frontend/packages/ui` component library.

## Architecture

- A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app written using TypeScript
- Uses the Tadoku component library "ui" from within the workspace
- All forms are written with [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- Dates are manipulated using [Luxon](https://github.com/moment/luxon/)
